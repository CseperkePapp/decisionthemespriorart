# Decision Themes — Release Notes
### Version 0.1 (Initial Public Architecture Release)

This release marks the **first complete publication** of the Decision Themes architecture, including:
- layered model
- semantic dictionary system
- DT lattice logic
- connector theory
- Composer behavior

# 🚀 Highlights

### ✔️ **Five-Layer Architecture Documented**
All major layers of the Decision Themes system are fully defined:
- VT (Value Theme)
- DTD (Dictionary)
- DTs (Decision Themes)
- Composer
- Effective Theme

### ✔️ **Connector System Published**
Typed connectors with role/property footprint logic and subset-matching algorithm.

### ✔️ **Design Lattice Model Introduced**
DT modules form a DAG (forks, joins, overlays), enabling highly modular, domain-specific design logic.

### ✔️ **Three-Machine Pipeline Formalized**
- Machine A: Modeler
- Machine B: DTS Editor
- Machine C: Renderer

### ✔️ **Full Example Bundle**
Includes:
- VT seed
- Dictionary
- spine/voice/shared DTs
- device overlays
- Composer

### ✔️ **All Architectural, Spec, and Prior Art Docs Added**
Ready for reviewers, contributors, or future implementers.
