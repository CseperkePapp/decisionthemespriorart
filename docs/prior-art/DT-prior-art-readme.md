# Decision Themes — Prior Art Documentation
### README (v0.1)
### Status: Public Prior Art Disclosure

This folder contains the **official defensive publication** for the **Decision Themes architecture**. It establishes public, timestamped prior art, preventing any entity from patenting the concepts, structures, mechanisms, or workflows described here.

All documents in this folder are licensed under the MIT License to ensure unrestricted public access and permanent openness.

# 📐 Overview

Decision Themes introduces a **Cascading Decision System** for building **custom design lattices** using:

- **Value Themes (VT)** – raw values
- **Decision Themes Dictionaries (DTD)** – first semantic layer
- **Decision Themes (DTs)** – modular logic modules with typed connectors
- **Design Decision Composer (DDC)** – declarative assembly layer
- **Effective Theme (ET)** – fully resolved output
- **Three‑machine pipeline** – content modeler → DTS editor → renderer

These elements together define a novel, modular, semantically structured methodology for building robust, domain‑specific design systems.

# 🧭 Purpose of This Folder

This folder serves a single legal and technical purpose:

> **To create durable, timestamped, public prior art covering the Decision Themes architecture.**

This prevents anyone from patenting:
- the semantic dictionary layer
- the modular DT lattice structure
- typed connectors
- the Declarative Composer
- the dependency resolution mechanisms
- the end-to-end pipeline model

and ensures these innovations remain permanently available.

# 🔒 Legal Remarks

- MIT License ensures openness and prevents proprietary enclosure.
- Publication in this repository constitutes a dated public disclosure.
- These documents are sufficient to invalidate any future patent claims covering the same mechanisms.

---

# 📣 Next Steps

You may extend this folder with:
- additional diagrams
- example dictionaries
- example DTs
- sample Composer files
- architecture notes

Once this repository is released publicly (and optionally archived via Zenodo for DOI), the defensive publication becomes permanent.
