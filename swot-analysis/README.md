# SWOT Analysis Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analyses for each major release version of the Decision Themes Prior Art repository.

## Why SWOT Analysis for Each Release?

SWOT analyses help us:
- **Track evolution**: Understand how strengths and weaknesses change over time
- **Strategic planning**: Identify opportunities and threats for future development
- **Stakeholder communication**: Provide clear assessment for contributors and users
- **Decision-making**: Guide prioritization of features and improvements
- **Prior art documentation**: Maintain comprehensive understanding of the project's position

## File Naming Convention

SWOT analysis files follow this pattern:
```
SWOT-v{VERSION}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md
```

**Examples:**
- `SWOT-v0.1-2025-11-20.md` - Initial release analysis
- `SWOT-v0.2-2025-12-15.md` - Second release analysis
- `SWOT-v1.0-2026-03-01.md` - Major version analysis

## When to Create a SWOT Analysis

A new SWOT analysis should be created:
- ✅ **For each major release** (v0.1, v0.2, v1.0, etc.)
- ✅ **For significant minor releases** (v1.1, v1.2 if substantial changes)
- ✅ **Annually** for active projects, even without version changes
- ✅ **After major pivots** or strategic direction changes
